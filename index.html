			<h1> Hello, I am Théophile</h1>
			<img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" class="img-circle" alt="Théophile Renault">
			<p> I am passionate about endurance sports and motorsport (especially Formula 1). I plan on doing a Ironman 70.3 next year and that is the reason why this year I have a up to five trainings sessions a week. Formula 1 is a real passion for me and I follow each and every race week-end (even if there are 23 of them during the season;)

			<h2>Running</h2>
			<p>It's been three years since I have started running. It not only clears your mind and makes you think of everything but the everyday struggles, but also it enables you to quantify your progression in the sport. This is an aspect which I really like because you can the effect of your training immediately. </p>

			<h2>F1 and Motorsport</h2>
			<p> I love racing. Watching and doing it by yourself really gives you adrenalin and lots of other emotions that I could not posibly put into words</p>

			<h2>Windsurfing</h2>
			<p>I really enjoy windsurfing and sports realted to water in general. They give a sense a freedom and speed. The fact that you are traveling at suh high speeds just by the force of wind is in my mind incredible.</p>
